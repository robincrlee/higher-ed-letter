## 傳給教授們的模板

溝通策略來說，我覺得要對系所、學校做兩方面的遊說，一個是告訴他們燃眉之急、一個是對美國的移民政策更積極回應。
這樣的信，也會讓國際學生更有說服力。因為我們不是只關心留學生的權益，也是在意整體美國、其他弱勢族群的政策。

記得根據你的情況多做修改。反正現在情況不明，盡量能把不確定性、擔心反映給學校、系所、教授，他們才可能更會關心。
畢竟很多人可能也都有類似的簽證問題、難處，我相信滿多人都會願意幫助我們的。

兩個 disclaimer 先說明
- 裡面有些 sarcasm （像是 beloved ICE agents）。自行斟酌喔～
- 或許有些朋友不同意我把中國留學生的規定放進去例子，但我覺得要減少中國共產黨的勢力，美國政府應該更精準，現在全盤的排斥，可能會有更強烈愛國主義。

Dear [Department Chair, Advisor or Graduate school dean]

Happy Fourth of July. I hope you had a relaxing and fulfilling time! I had some break from all the news but unfortuantely today I saw a concerning policy announcement from ICE. 

I'm writing today in response to [ICE's policy announcement on the visa status of international students enrolled in US universities on 7/6](https://www.ice.gov/news/releases/sevp-modifies-temporary-exemptions-nonimmigrant-students-taking-online-courses-during). 

It lays out three types of scenarios: 
a) hybrid of online and in-person, 
b) normal in-person and 
c) fully online. 

Each of them has a different restriction of the number of classes allowed to be taken online. In the current pandemic, case b is rare. In case c, students may need to leave the US otherwise they will face deportation proceedings. The hybrid format is the most common, yet the most ambiguous in terms of how ICE agents will treat us. The exact details and interpretation remains debated among many immigration attorneys. 

This has been a change from the past spring semester where the US federal government exempted the in-residence requirement for international students.

I'm seeking your help to facilitate discussions the following questions among other faculty and administrators.

- Under this rule, what does our university fall under? As far as I know, there are different instruction formats across years, programs (undergrad vs grad) and departments. How will the fragmentation of policy rules affect many international students like me in terms of the ability to travel into and out of the US as well as the ability to reside in the US without fears? Specifically, how will doctorate students who no longer take classes be categorized and treated by our beloved ICE agents?

- What might be possible action and research our department and field can take on to make our academic communities and school more aware of the US immigration policy? What are possible ways for us come up with new resources and tactics to engage with the increasing xenophobic policy?

Many of our classes have move into virtual instruction. I'm concerned about the immediate impact to me. 
While graduate students' instruction have gone mostly hybrid, it remains concerning. 
ICE agents have been known to behave with higher level of hostility towards foreign students, workers and immigrants both at the border and in the US. 

Does that mean that everytime I travel into and outside of the US, I may face increased risk for deportation? 
Would we need to carry documents to prove that we have in-person class while we learn, research and shop for grocery in [my town]?


As for the trend mentioned in the second topic, there has been a series of policy changes to make life more unbearable for all types of foreigners. It matches with the Trump administration campaign rhetoric and policy pattern since the travel ban in Jan 2017. The following is a sample of policy changes that took place in 2020.

- April: [suspension of new immigration visas (green-cards)](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/proclamation-suspending-entry-immigrants-present-risk-u-s-labor-market-economic-recovery-following-covid-19-outbreak/)
- May: [limitation of Chinese international students with link to PLA](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-06-07/trump-move-to-bar-entry-of-some-chinese-graduate-students-stirs-campus-anxiety-anger)
- June: [suspension of new H1B, H2B working visas](https://www.huffingtonpost.in/entry/h1b-visa-h2b-united-states-trump-order-what-does-it-mean_in_5ef32b00c5b6aa825ac96504); [changes in work permits for asylum seekers](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-rule-asylum-seekers-work-permits)
- July: higher education rule that I'm writing you about

While June has seen good news from the Supreme Court on DACA, overall the immigration (broadly-defined) policy has been really really tough on foreigners.
All these make me worried and make me believe that the administration is actively making lives unbearable for me, many foreigners and immigrants to achieve "self-deportation".

The international students center has conducted mostly counseling info sessions for students to learn about the rules and support each other. Yet, it is mostly reactive and compliance of rules. Perhaps because of organizational constraints, it has not served as a role to advocate or reimagine a better strategy in how to treat international students. They are already overwhelmed with day-to-day affairs, let alone prepare for the policy changes.

However, I'm optimistic about our innovative capacity across departments and universities. [Princeton University and University of California has made innovative tactics in protecting people in DACA status through lawsuits](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/06/19/supreme-court-daca-decision-university-response/).

It is in these personal and collective concerns that I bring up both sets of discussion questions. I'd be interested in your and other faculty's inputs on how to make international students free from fear to generate knowledge and live in the US. How do we make use our knowledge for a better world? How do we as academic researchers come up with innovative ways to combat xenophobia in public opinion and policy implementation?

Thank you for your time. Look forward to seeing the conversation this brings to our department and community.
